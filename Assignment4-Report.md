# Introduction
This lab explores mutation and GUI testing to familiarize ourselves with the processes involved with these tests. We also get the opportunity to explore testing tools.

Mutation testing is when the SUT is modified in order to assess the quality of test cases and help improve them. We are using `Pitest` on our java code from previous labs to inject faults and learn to interpret mutation scores.

GUI testing is when a GUI is tested through clicks and inputs which cannot be modeled like regular JUnit tests. We will use Selenium to record and replay test cases developed for the Sportcheck page, Walmart page, or Best Buy page. We will also explore and compare the `Sikulix` tool as an alternative.
# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
